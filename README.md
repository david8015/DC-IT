2. Github – remote repository
3. Boostrap (html, CSS) – layout the page

7. Postman – test / verify API calls
. Bash – command line interface



                         Challenges / areas of opportunity 

1. working independently – combining our files
2. loaded webpages dynamically – targeting elements to retrieve information
3. abstraction (new projects) – focus on abstracting out some of the code, make it more efficient and compact
4. saving / storing information – session storage
5. loading DOM dynamically and asynchronous functions 


                     
                                Successes / What went well 

1. we adapted our pair programming approach and worked on one computer (file) at a time
2. used our resources when needed
3. we were both committed to our project (time and effort)
4. we accomplished what we set out to do


Final thought:
We had our successes, we had our challenges but overall it was a learning experience and for that I am grateful.
